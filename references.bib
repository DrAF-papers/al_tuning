The influence of the parameters of anodic film formation on the coating characteristics and layer thickness of aluminum alloys has been investigated.

Changes in anodic coating weight and film thickness of aluminium alloys with the process parameters as current density, temperature, time duration, acid concentration, and sealing system have been studied.

Of the numerous possibilities to positively influence the process of such joints we investigate using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser to generate spot joints of thin foils in combination with a beam shaping optic to tailor the temperature profile during laser spot joining of thin foils. This allows for increased contact area, stabilized process behavior and offers the potential for joining ultra thin foils far below 100 \textmu m. Different configurations are examined, results are presented and discussed, mainly in terms of their general impact on the micro joining process.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) embedded within digital models of manufacturing processes can be used to improve process productivity and product quality significantly. The application of such advanced capabilities particularly to highly digitalized processes such as metal additive manufacturing (AM) is likely to make those processes commercially more attractive. AI capabilities will reside within Digital Twins (DTs) which are living virtual replicas of the physical processes. DTs will be empowered to operate autonomously in a diagnostic control ca\- pacity to supervise processes and can be interrogated by the practitioner to inform the optimal processing route for any given product. The utility of the information gained from the DTs would depend on the quality of the digital models and, more importantly, their faster-solving surrogates which dwell within DTs for consultation during rapid decision-making. In this article, we point out the exceptional value of DTs in AM and focus on the need to create high-fidelity multiscale-multiphysics models for AM processes to feed the AI capabilities. We identify technical hurdles for their development, including those arising from the multiscale and multiphysics characteristics of the models, the difficulties in linking models of the subprocesses across scales and physics, and the scarcity of experimental data. We discuss the need for creating surrogate models using machine learning approaches for real-time problem-solving. We further identify non-technical barriers, such as the need for standardization and difficulties in collaborating across different types of institutions. We offer potential solutions for all these challenges, after reflecting on and researching discussions held at an international symposium on the subject in 2019. We argue that a collaborative approach can not only help accelerate their development compared with disparate efforts, but also enhance the quality of the models by allowing modular development and linkages that account for interactions between the various sub-processes in AM. A high-level roadmap is suggested for starting such a collaboration.},

Typically, cuboidal specimens with arbitrarily selected dimensions are built. An optimum set of parameters, determined on such specimens, is used for building parts with variable cross-section areas. However, it gives no guarantee that the density of variable-section parts produced with so selected parameters will be as high as that of the specimens measured during the parameters optimization process. The goal of this work was to improve the process of SLM parameter selection according to the criterion of maximum relative density, based on the example of AISI H13 tool steel (1.2344). A selection method of scanning strategy ensuring relative density of parts over 99\%, irrespective of their dimensions, was determined. The specimens were produced using several variants of support structures. It was found that proper selection of the support strategy prevents development of columnar pores.},

To take advantage of the strengths of both physics-based and data-driven models, we propose a novel hybrid modeling framework for laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) processes. Our unbiased model integration method combines physics-based data and measurement data for approaching more accurate prediction of melt pool width. Both a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and experiments utilizing optical images are used to generate a combined dataset of melt pool widths. From this aggregated dataset, a hybrid model is developed using data-driven modeling techniques, including polynomial regression and Kriging methods. The performance of the hybrid model is evaluated by computing the average relative error and compared with the results of the simulations and surrogate models constructed from the original CFD model and experimental measurements. It is found that the proposed hybrid model performs better in terms of prediction accuracy and computational time. Future work includes a conceptual introduction on the use of an AM ontology to support improved model and data selection when constructing hybrid models. This study can be viewed as a significant step towards the use of hybrid models as predictive models with improves accuracy without the sacrifice of speed.},

The process is repetitive and fully automated, but the interactions between layers during deposition are tightly coupled. To unravel these interactions, the computational models of the manufacturing process are critically needed. However, current state-of-the-art physics-based models are computationally demanding and cannot be used for any realistic optimization. To address this challenge, we built a surrogate model (SM) of thermal profiles that significantly reduced the computational cost. We built this model based on the observation that any AM process exhibits a high level of redundancy and periodicity, making it an ideal problem for machine learning and surrogate modeling.},

The densities can be described as linear functions of temperature with negative slopes. Moreover, they increase monotonically with an increase of Si concentration. In a temperature range between 1100 and 1400 \textdegree C, it can be deduced from the composition dependence of the density that virtually no excess volume arises during alloying of the pure elements. For lower temperatures an excess volume is discussed, considering the temperature dependence of Si density literature data.

Nelder\textendash Mead Simplex Method is very easy to implement in practice, because it does not require gradient computation; however, it is very sensitive to the choice of initial points selected. Fan\textendash Zahara conducted a sensitivity study using a select set of test cases and suggested the best values for the parameters based on the highest percentage rate of successful minimization. Begambre\textendash Laier used a strategy to control the Particle Swarm Optimization parameters based on the Nelder Mead Simplex Method in identifying structural damage. The main purpose of the paper is to extend their parameter sensitivity study to better understand the parameter's behavior. The comprehensive parameter sensitivity study was conducted on seven test functions: B2, Beale, Booth, Wood, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock and Sphere Functions to search for common patterns and relationships each parameter has in producing the optimum solution. The results show important relations of the Nelder\textendash Mead Simplex parameters: reflection, expansion, contraction, and Simplex size and how they impact the optimum solutions. This study is crucial, because better understanding of the parameters behavior can motivate current and future research using Nelder\textendash Mead Simplex in creating an intelligent algorithm, which can be more effective, efficient, and save computational time.},

While finite element modeling and closed-loop control have been identified key for predicting and engineering part qualities in PBF, existing results in each realm are developed in opposite computational architectures wildly different in time scale. This paper builds a first-instance closed-loop simulation framework by integrating high-fidelity finite element modeling with feedback controls originally developed for general mechatronics systems. By utilizing the output signals (e.g., melt pool width) retrieved from the finite element model (FEM) to upyear directly the control signals (e.g., laser power) sent to the model, the proposed closed-loop framework enables testing the limits of advanced controls in PBF and surveying the parameter space fully to generate more predictable part qualities. Along the course of formulating the framework, we verify the FEM by comparing its results with experimental and analytical solutions and then use the FEM to understand the melt-pool evolution induced by the in- and cross-layer thermomechanical interactions. From there, we build a repetitive control (RC) algorithm to attenuate variations of the melt pool width.},

  abstract = {As a promising powder-based additive manufacturing technology, selective laser melting (SLM) has gained great popularity in recent years. However, experimental observation of the melting and solidification process is very challenging. This hinders the study of the physical mechanisms behind a variety of phenomena in SLM such as splashing and balling effects, and further poses challenges to the quality control of the products. Powder-scale computational models can reproduce the multiphysics process of SLM. In this study, we couple the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and Discrete Element Method to model the deposition of powder particles, and use the FVM to model the melting process, both with ambient air. In particular, a cutting-edge sharp surface capturing technique (iso-Advector) is incorporated into the Volume of Fluid Model to reconstruct the interface between different phases during the melting process. Iso-Advector is then used to capture and reconstruct the interface between molten material and ambient air, which is further used as a solid boundary for spreading the next powder layer. As such, 3D geometrical data is exchanged between these two stages repeatedly to reproduce the powder spreadingmelting process of SLM incorporating different scan paths on multiple powder layers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the powder-scale multi-physics modeling framework, typical scenarios with different fabrication parameters (Ti\textendash 6Al\textendash 4V powder) are simulated and compared with experimental observations available in literature.},

  abstract = {The use of scandium in aluminum alloys is of interest due to the strengthening effects, particularly at elevated temperatures. This work describes two different approaches to the use of scandium that have not been well studied. The first is the combined use of scandium and ceramic particles to improve the elevated temperature performance of aluminum alloys. The second is preliminary work in using scandium in combination with cerium, another element that has demonstrated good high temperature performance.},
