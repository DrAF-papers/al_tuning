The results show that in the range of 500-1300 \textdegree C, equilibrium phases of the mixture include Austenite and Ferrite, and the carbides include M2(C,N), M6C, M7C3 and M23C6. As the content of F304 in the mixture increases, the phase transition temperature A1 of the mixture decreases, and {$\mathsl{A}$} first decreases and then increases; in the equilibrium phase, the content of Austenite and Ferrite increases, and the content of carbide decreases until the carbides M7C3 and M6C gradually disappear. Density, coefficient of linear expansion, thermal conductivity, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and specific heat capacity of different mixture materials vary with temperature in a complex manner. Strength and hardness of the mixture formed when the content of F304 is 20 \% is the highest. The finer the grain size of the mixture, the higher the strength and hardness of the material. Comparing standard physical property data of F304 stainless steel at room temperature with the simulation calculation results, it is found that the error is small, which verifies the accuracy of the simulation calculation results.},

Experimental procedures are performed using sulfuric acid at different values of current density (1 - 2 A/dm2). The influence of the parameters of anodic film formation on the coating characteristics and layer thickness of aluminum alloys has been investigated. Reflectance and optical properties of the anodized aluminum alloy coatings are determined and found to be dependent on the alloying elements. Changes in anodic coating weight and film thickness of aluminium alloys with the process parameters as current density, temperature, time duration, acid concentration, and sealing system have been studied. Moreover, morphology and surface structure of the considered samples are carried out in attempt to understand the physical characteristics. The obtained results are compared and briefly outlined.},

However, high thermal conductivity and thermal expansion of common materials largely prohibit spot joints with a sufficiently large contact area needed to satisfy mechanical and electrical requirements. Of the numerous possibilities to positively influence the process of such joints we investigate using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser to generate spot joints of thin foils in combination with a beam shaping optic to tailor the temperature profile during laser spot joining of thin foils. This allows for increased contact area, stabilized process behavior and offers the potential for joining ultra thin foils far below 100 \textmu m.

  abstract = {Boron steel is one of the most valuable lightweight steels for automobile due to its high strength after hot stamping and low cost. In order to ensure service performance of automobile parts, the steel is required to have good hardenability. A novel data-driven machine learning (ML) model has been established by using relevant material descriptors, including chemical composition and distance along the Jominy bar, to predict the hardenability curve of boron steel. By evaluating and comparing prediction results of different ML methods on training and test sets, random forest is found to be the optimal model with high correlation coefficient and low error. Moreover, the ML model performs better than JMatPro and empirical formula in terms of prediction accuracy and variation trend of hardenability curve. The optimal ML model combined with orthogonal design is employed to successfully design a press-hardening steel with good hardenability, i.e., 0.04\% V-added boron steel. Therefore, this study demonstrates that ML can predict accurately and efficiently the hardenability curve of boron steel and guide the material design and heat treatment process of advanced boron steel.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) embedded within digital models of manufacturing processes can be used to improve process productivity and product quality significantly. The application of such advanced capabilities particularly to highly digitalized processes such as metal additive manufacturing (AM) is likely to make those processes commercially more attractive. AI capabilities will reside within Digital Twins (DTs) which are living virtual replicas of the physical processes. DTs will be empowered to operate autonomously in a diagnostic control ca\- pacity to supervise processes and can be interrogated by the practitioner to inform the optimal processing route for any given product. The utility of the information gained from the DTs would depend on the quality of the digital models and, more importantly, their faster-solving surrogates which dwell within DTs for consultation during rapid decision-making. In this article, we point out the exceptional value of DTs in AM and focus on the need to create high-fidelity multiscale-multiphysics models for AM processes to feed the AI capabilities. We identify technical hurdles for their development, including those arising from the multiscale and multiphysics characteristics of the models, the difficulties in linking models of the subprocesses across scales and physics, and the scarcity of experimental data. We discuss the need for creating surrogate models using machine learning approaches for real-time problem-solving. We further identify non-technical barriers, such as the need for standardization and difficulties in collaborating across different types of institutions. We offer potential solutions for all these challenges, after reflecting on and researching discussions held at an international symposium on the subject in 2019. We argue that a collaborative approach can not only help accelerate their development compared with disparate efforts, but also enhance the quality of the models by allowing modular development and linkages that account for interactions between the various sub-processes in AM. A high-level roadmap is suggested for starting such a collaboration.},

  abstract = {Ultra-high strength 7xxx series aluminum alloys are widely used in aerospace applications due to their excep\- tional high specific strength. Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is a combination of arc and wire feeding additive manufacturing technology including either the gas tungsten arc (GTA) or the gas metal arc (GMA) process. And this technology has been applied in the aerospace manufacturing industry to reduce the time of product development and ``buy-to-fly'' ratios. However, the existing Al-Zn-Mg-Cu aluminum alloy filler wires are not suitable for WAAM process due to their high susceptibility to hot cracks. In this study, a novel Al-Zn-MgCu-Sc aluminum alloy wire named 7A55-Sc with ultra-high strength and excellent hot-crack resistance has been successfully prepared by optimizing the composition of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloying elements and adding appropriate amounts of inoculants Sc and Zr elements during the smelting process. And then, thin-wall components without any hot cracks were successfully fabricated by using cold metal transfer (CMT) process. Results indicated that the microstructure of the as-deposited 7A55-Sc alloy consists of predominantly fine equiaxed grains and the average size of the grains is between 5.0 and 6.0 {$\mu$}m. The eutectics composed of {$\alpha$} (Al), {$\eta$} phase and S phase were distributed along the grain boundaries. The Al3Sc and Al3 (Zr, Sc) particles precipitated within grains act as heterogeneous nucleation nuclei, promoting the formation of the equiaxed grains. After T6 heat treatment, most of the second phases distributed within grains and grain boundaries were dissolved into the {$\alpha$}(Al) matrix. The distribution of alloy elements became more homogeneous. The average ultimate tensile strength, yield strength and elongation of T6 heat-treated 7A55-Sc alloy in the horizontal direction were 554 MPa, 488 MPa and 1.7\% respectively, whereas 523 MPa, 469 MPa and 1.4\% in the vertical direction. The lower ductility was considered due to the existence of a large number of pores in the 7A55-Sc alloy fabricated by the CMT process.},

Typically, cuboidal specimens with arbitrarily selected dimensions are built. An optimum set of parameters, determined on such specimens, is used for building parts with variable cross-section areas. However, it gives no guarantee that the density of variable-section parts produced with so selected parameters will be as high as that of the specimens measured during the parameters optimization process. The goal of this work was to improve the process of SLM parameter selection according to the criterion of maximum relative density, based on the example of AISI H13 tool steel (1.2344). A selection method of scanning strategy ensuring relative density of parts over 99\%, irrespective of their dimensions, was determined. The specimens were produced using several variants of support structures. It was found that proper selection of the support strategy prevents development of columnar pores.},

  abstract = {Directed energy deposition (DED), also known as laser cladding, is a metal additive manufacturing process in which a highpower laser combined with a coaxial powder delivery system is used to additively manufacture a three-dimensional metal component layer-by-layer. Due to its convenience and superior quality, DED has gained popularity in recent years. However, despite many advantages, it has low deposition efficiency and produces parts with poor surface evenness, high porosity, and poor mechanical properties. This study performs one-factor-at-a-time experiments to valuate five DED processing parameters, namely the laser and powder focus point positions, laser head raising height (Z-offset), laser power, powder feed rate, and laser scanning speed. The laser and powder focus point positions and the Z-offset are first adjusted to maximize the surface evenness and deposition efficiency. Several experiments are then performed to investigate the effects of laser power, powder feed rate, and laser cladding speed on the porosity and dilution of DED-built parts. Finally, a mathematical model is proposed to predict the quality (i.e., dilution) of DED-built parts as a function of DED processing parameters. Based on the results, the optimal focus point positions and Z-offset are found. The variations of porosity and dilution with three processing parameters are shown. The proposed model can be used to set up DED processing parameters to produce higher quality parts on the first attempt.},

Based on the prediction of JMatPro and the experimental measurement, an accurate modified prediction model of JMatPro for the tensile strength of UHSHSS was proposed in the study, considering the influence of austenitizing temperature. At the same time, the prediction model of phase transition in quenching process of UHSHSS was established. The tensile strength and phase transition models of UHSHSS under different conditions were studied using the prediction models. Results showed that the tensile strength of UHSHSS increased with the increase of C content and decreased with the increase of Si content. For every 0.01 wt\% increase in C content, the tensile strength increased by around 30 MPa. For the hot stamping process used in this study, the carbon content of hot stamping steel should be more than 0.35 wt\% to achieve 2000 MPa in tensile strength. The volume fraction of the residual austenite in UHSHSS increased with the increase of C and Si content. During the quenching process, the phase transition in UHSHSS was the fastest between 4 s and 8 s, and the average decomposition rate of the austenite reached 17.8\% per second. The average volume fraction of residual austenite and martensite in UHSHSS was 3.3\% and 96.7\%, respectively, when the quenching die temperature was 150  C. With the increase of the die temperature, the volume fraction of residual austenite in steel increased.},

  abstract = {Multi-scale multi-physics computational models are a promising tool to provide detailed insights to understand the processstructure-property-performance relationships in additive manufacturing (AM) processes. To take advantage of the strengths of both physics-based and data-driven models, we propose a novel hybrid modeling framework for laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) processes. Our unbiased model integration method combines physics-based data and measurement data for approaching more accurate prediction of melt pool width. Both a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and experiments utilizing optical images are used to generate a combined dataset of melt pool widths. From this aggregated dataset, a hybrid model is developed using data-driven modeling techniques, including polynomial regression and Kriging methods. The performance of the hybrid model is evaluated by computing the average relative error and compared with the results of the simulations and surrogate models constructed from the original CFD model and experimental measurements. It is found that the proposed hybrid model performs better in terms of prediction accuracy and computational time. Future work includes a conceptual introduction on the use of an AM ontology to support improved model and data selection when constructing hybrid models. This study can be viewed as a significant step towards the use of hybrid models as predictive models with improves accuracy without the sacrifice of speed.},

The presented model consists of analytical thermal modeling, thermal stress modeling, residual stress modeling, and distortion modeling.

The temperature profile is calculated using a moving point heat source solution and heat sink solution with consideration of heat input from a moving laser and heat loss from boundary heat transfer. The thermal stress is calculated from the temperature calculation using a thermal stress model considering thermal load, surface tension, and hydrostatic pressure. The residual stress is calculated from the thermal stress calculation using an elastoplastic relaxation procedure. The residual stress\textendash induced part distortion is finally calculated from the calculated residual stress and residual strain using a surface displacement model. The calculated part distortion was validated to experimental measurement on a twin-cantilever part produced by PBMAM of Ti6Al4V. Close agreements were observed. The computational time was recorded less than 10 s. The high predictive accuracy and high computational efficiency allow the process parameter planning for distortion control and elimination through inverse analysis.},

Nevertheless, complex physics and multi-scale nature of the problem make an accurate prediction of residual stress at the part level a great challenge. Thus, the present study developed the finite element framework to predict the part scale residual stress development in the LPBF of Inconel 718. Two-scale models were used coherently. A mesoscale model calculated the stress formation in a deposited powder layer by considering the influence of process conditions and scan strategies. Subsequently, the inherent strain approach was used for the part level prediction. The inherent strain values were estimated according to numerical results from the mesoscale model. Numerical validation was made by comparing the transient development of residual stress with reported measurements from the neutron diffraction of over 200 data points. The proposed framework provided the prediction which matched excellently with experimental results. Ultimately, the present study established the proven framework which could be used for further investigation on part scale-related issues in the LPBF process.},

The process is repetitive and fully automated, but the interactions between layers during deposition are tightly coupled. To unravel these interactions, the computational models of the manufacturing process are critically needed. However, current state-of-the-art physics-based models are computationally demanding and cannot be used for any realistic optimization. To address this challenge, we built a surrogate model (SM) of thermal profiles that significantly reduced the computational cost. We built this model based on the observation that any AM process exhibits a high level of redundancy and periodicity, making it an ideal problem for machine learning and surrogate modeling.},

The densities can be described as linear functions of temperature with negative slopes. Moreover, they increase monotonically with an increase of Si concentration. In a temperature range between 1100 and 1400 \textdegree C, it can be deduced from the composition dependence of the density that virtually no excess volume arises during alloying of the pure elements. For lower temperatures an excess volume is discussed, considering the temperature dependence of Si density literature data.

The results show important relations of the Nelder\textendash Mead Simplex parameters: reflection, expansion, contraction, and Simplex size and how they impact the optimum solutions. This study is crucial, because better understanding of the parameters behavior can motivate current and future research using Nelder\textendash Mead Simplex in creating an intelligent algorithm, which can be more effective, efficient, and save computational time.},

While finite element modeling and closed-loop control have been identified key for predicting and engineering part qualities in PBF, existing results in each realm are developed in opposite computational architectures wildly different in time scale. This paper builds a first-instance closed-loop simulation framework by integrating high-fidelity finite element modeling with feedback controls originally developed for general mechatronics systems. By utilizing the output signals (e.g., melt pool width) retrieved from the finite element model (FEM) to update directly the control signals (e.g., laser power) sent to the model, the proposed closed-loop framework enables testing the limits of advanced controls in PBF and surveying the parameter space fully to generate more predictable part qualities. Along the course of formulating the framework, we verify the FEM by comparing its results with experimental and analytical solutions and then use the FEM to understand the melt-pool evolution induced by the in- and cross-layer thermomechanical interactions. From there, we build a repetitive control (RC) algorithm to attenuate variations of the melt pool width.},

However, its broad adoption in industry is still hindered by high entry barriers of design for additive manufacturing (DfAM), limited materials library, various processing defects, and inconsistent product quality.

This article provides a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of ML applications in a variety of AM domains. In the DfAM, ML can be leveraged to output new high-performance metamaterials and optimized topological designs. In AM processing, contemporary ML algorithms can help to optimize process para\- meters, and conduct examination of powder spreading and in-process defect monitoring. On the production of AM, ML is able to assist practitioners in pre-manufacturing planning, and product quality assessment and control. Moreover, there has been an increasing concern about data security in AM as data breaches could occur with the aid of ML techniques. Lastly, it concludes with a section summarizing the main findings from the literature and providing perspectives on some selected interesting applications of ML in research and development of AM.},

However, experimental observation of the melting and solidification process is very challenging. This hinders the study of the physical mechanisms behind a variety of phenomena in SLM such as splashing and balling effects, and further poses challenges to the quality control of the products. Powder-scale computational models can reproduce the multiphysics process of SLM. In this study, we couple the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and Discrete Element Method to model the deposition of powder particles, and use the FVM to model the melting process, both with ambient air. In particular, a cutting-edge sharp surface capturing technique (iso-Advector) is incorporated into the Volume of Fluid Model to reconstruct the interface between different phases during the melting process. Iso-Advector is then used to capture and reconstruct the interface between molten material and ambient air, which is further used as a solid boundary for spreading the next powder layer. As such, 3D geometrical data is exchanged between these two stages repeatedly to reproduce the powder spreadingmelting process of SLM incorporating different scan paths on multiple powder layers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the powder-scale multi-physics modeling framework, typical scenarios with different fabrication parameters (Ti\textendash 6Al\textendash 4V powder) are simulated and compared with experimental observations available in literature.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an analytical modeling method for the prediction of lack-of-fusion porosity of parts fabricated by laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF), with the consideration of boundary heat transfer and sensitivity to laser power absorption. The temperature distribution of the part was first predicted by an analytical thermal model, which consists of a linear heat source solution and a heat sink solution. The temperature increase due to laser power input was calculated by the point moving heat source solution. The temperature drop due to thermal conduction, convection, and radiation at part boundaries was calculated by the heat sink solution. The coefficient of laser power absorption was inversely obtained by comparing predicted molten pool widths with experimental measurements. The lack-of-fusion area was then calculated by plotting molten pool shapes of multitracks and multi-layers on a transverse cross-sectional area of the part. The powder bed porosity was calculated by an advancing front method with the consideration of powder size distribution and packing pattern. Finally, the lack-of-fusion porosity was obtained by multiplying the lack-of-fusion area with powder bed porosity. The predicted results were close to the measurements of Ti6Al4V in LPBF. The maximum deviation for porosity prediction is 5.91\%. The presented model shows high computational efficiency without relying on iteration-based numerical method. The computational time for five consecutive layers is less than 100 s. The acceptable accuracy, short computational time, and the ability to consider complex boundary effects make the proposed method a good basis for future research and a promising tool for optimization of process parameters in LPBF of complex parts.},

  abstract = {The use of scandium in aluminum alloys is of interest due to the strengthening effects, particularly at elevated temperatures. This work describes two different approaches to the use of scandium that have not been well studied. The first is the combined use of scandium and ceramic particles to improve the elevated temperature performance of aluminum alloys. The second is preliminary work in using scandium in combination with cerium, another element that has demonstrated good high temperature performance.},

  abstract = {The recent explosion of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) shows great potential in the breakthrough of metal additive manufacturing (AM) process modeling, which is an indispensable step to derive the process-structure-property relationship. However, the success of conventional machine learning tools in data science is primarily attributed to the unprecedented large amount of labeled data-sets (big data), which can be either obtained by experiments or first-principle simulations. Unfortunately, these labeled data-sets are expensive to obtain in AM due to the high expense of the AM experiments and prohibitive computational cost of high-fidelity simulations, hindering the direct applications of big-data based ML tools to metal AM problems.},

  abstract = {A physics-informed neural network is developed to solve conductive heat transfer partial differential equation (PDE), along with convective heat transfer PDEs as boundary conditions (BCs), in manufacturing and engineering applications where parts are heated in ovens. Since convective coefficients are typically unknown, current analysis approaches based on trial-and-error finite element (FE) simulations are slow. The loss function is defined based on errors to satisfy PDE, BCs and initial condition. An adaptive normalizing scheme is developed to reduce loss terms simultaneously. In addition, theory of heat transfer is used for feature engineering. The predictions for 1D and 2D cases are validated by comparing with FE results. While comparing with theory-agnostic ML methods, it is shown that only by using physics-informed activation functions, the heat transfer beyond the training zone can be accurately predicted. Trained models were successfully used for real-time evaluation of thermal responses of parts subjected to a wide range of convective BCs.},
