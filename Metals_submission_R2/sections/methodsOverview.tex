This body of work begins by describing the thermal model which was developed to simulate the metal \ac{AM} deposition process for any metal where the material properties could be determined.  This model is then validated using a well characterized material, Ti-64.  Upon validation of the thermal model, it is applied to a generic aluminum alloy, and then experimentation is used to determine if the results are a good representation of the physical process.  When found to be inaccurate, a mathematical search algorithm was applied to the input parameters to increase the accuracy of the model's results.  Lastly, the optimal input dataset was validated by comparing the simulated results to experimental results with a range of laser scan speeds and power levels for the targeted aluminum alloy.
