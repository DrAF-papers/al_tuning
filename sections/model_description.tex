\label{model_description}

The model used in this study was developed in house and is detailed in \ref{OTHERPAPER}.
This simulation has the express goals of being efficient while still holding true to physics models.  In order to accomplish this, it heavily leverages GPU processing utilizing image processing techniques.  The simulation was developed with laser \ac{DED} processes in mind, however, it was developed in a modular manner such that it can be applied to most metal \ac{AM} processes.  

The main objective of the model is to accurately predict the thermal history of the build.  This was shown to be true in \ref{OTHERPAPER} where the model was able to predict the width of the melted track with approximately 3\% error and the depth within 1.7 resolution steps (which was approximately 20\% error).
