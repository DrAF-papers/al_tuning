\Acf{AM} simulations 
are effective for materials which are well characterized and published, however for newer or proprietary materials, they cannot provide accurate results due to the lack of knowledge of material properties.  
This work demonstrates the process of the application of mathematical search algorithms to develop an optimized material dataset which results in accurate simulations for the laser \ac{DED} proces.  
This was done  by first using a well characterized material, Ti-64, to show the accuracy of the melt pool dimensions predictions, less than 2 resolution steps.  Then with a 7000 series aluminum using a generic material property dataset from sister alloys, the error was found to be over 600\%
The Nelder-Mead search algorithm was then applied to the problem and was able to develop an optimized dataset which had a combined width and depth error of just 9.1\%.  
Demonstrating that it is possible to develop an optimized material property dateset which facilitated a more accurate simulation for an under-characterized material.
