It was found that the values of the laser absorption at the liquidus temperature and the specific heat at 733\degree C, for the optimized dataset were triple that of the generic dataset.  Conversely, at 922\degree C, the generic dataset was triple that of the optimized dataset values.  The thermal conductivity of the optimized dataset was about double that of the generic dataset at 1491\degree C.  Lastly, the laser diameter crudely estimated was nearly double that of the optimized input dataset.
