\label{conclusions}

This work shows that the Nelder-Mead search algorithm is an appropriate multidimensional search algorithm for the determination of the optimal dataset for improved simulation accuracy.  It was capable of reducing the simulated melt track depth and width of a set of processing parameters by over 500\%, as shown in Figures \ref{fig:melt_track_val_baseline} and Figure \ref{fig:melt_track_val}, which used datasets from literature (Table \ref{tab:starting_mat_prop_complete}) and the optimized dataset (Table \ref{tab:7000_mat_prop_complete}) respectively.  This was done by defining the response variable (Equation \ref{eqn:response}) for the search algorithm to be the sum of the error in the width and the depth, which facilitated an efficient search.  
This methodology can be used to develop accurate simulations for any material which is not well published or to increase the accuracy of a simulation which utilizes approximations of first principles in order to increase its efficiency.
